# ADR-6 — Immutable file sinks: finalized-only content, coverage-window naming

Status: Accepted (historical) — coverage naming/persistence not yet on mainline (GAP-17)

## Context

Files are immutable — a reorg cannot rewrite them. And files named after the min/max
block of their *rows* left gaps indistinguishable from never-indexed ranges when
tables were sparse (issue #122). Alternatives: name by row content (the bug), name
naively by cursor (breaks on sparse tables, trailing windows, disjoint ranges).

## Decision

File sinks write only finalized rows (hold-back buffer upstream) and name every
published unit for the **coverage window** the pipe processed for that table —
persisted per-table beside the cursor. Sparse tables stretch windows; stream-end
windows publish even when empty; state/data disagreement is refused before any
deletion.

## Consequences

Consumers can distinguish "empty" from "not indexed" (INV-4, RP-21); fork handling
reduces to dropping hold-back rows (CN-32). Costs: rows lag finality (deferred
visibility, INV-25), no-finality datasets lose reorg safety (FM-13), and recovery
depends on the author-purity obligation (RS-10, INV-43). Shapes DEF-14, DEF-15,
CN-12, IB-22.
