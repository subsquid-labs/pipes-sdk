   * different range, overlaps it (silent duplicate rows). So a failed `unlink` here is fatal —
   * we surface it with remediation guidance rather than swallowing it and counting it as removed.
   *
   * Reading the range off the filename is sound for both naming schemes: a coverage-named file
   * ends at the checkpoint cursor that published it, and a legacy min/max-named file ends at its
   * last row, which is itself never above that cursor. Either way `to > cursor` means "published
   * after the last commit".

   * straddles the commit point, so on the face of it it holds committed data (blocks `<= cursor`)
   * that a resume from `cursor + 1` will never re-fetch. Two very different things produce that
   * shape, and the persisted coverage tells them apart:
   *
   * - `from` equals the table's persisted coverage start — this is the file that table was about
   *   to publish when the checkpoint was interrupted. A sparse table's coverage start legitimately
   *   sits at or below the cursor (it kept the start while it sat out earlier checkpoints), so its
   *   *stretched* remnant straddles by construction. Its rows can only have come from processing
   *   blocks above the cursor, so a resume regenerates them: delete it like any other remnant.
   * - `from` is anything else — the files were written by a run that committed further than the
   *   cursor now records (a restored older state file, or a cursor rewound by hand). Deleting it
   *   would destroy committed data, so we refuse up front (scanning every table before deleting
   *   anything) and leave the operator a decision.
   *
   * With no persisted coverage (state predating coverage naming) nothing explains a straddle: a
   * row-min/max name's `from` is its first row, so committed rows really are inside. Refuse.
